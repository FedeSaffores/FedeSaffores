Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Fede
ðŸŽ† I am a Full Stack Developer. I became interested in programming in 2018, the year I started working as a freelancer. Later, I decided to consolidate my knowledge at the SoyHenry bootcamp, which was fundamental in providing me with the tools necessary to thrive in the job market.

During the course, I acquired and developed new skills in both Front-end and Back-end. I am a proactive and sociable person, always eager to test my acquired knowledge and seek opportunities to further improve my skills.

ðŸŒ± Experience ðŸŒ±
I have over a year of experience working as a Full Stack Developer at Henry, where I honed my skills in both Back-end and Front-end. Previously, I worked as a freelancer since 2018, which allowed me to tackle various projects and challenges that enriched my professional profile. Currently, I work for Virtual Sense, applying and expanding my knowledge on challenging projects.

ðŸ”— My Objective ðŸ”—
I would like to continue participating in projects that motivate me professionally, with the possibility of growing further as a developer. I aspire to work in an environment that fosters innovation and collaboration, where I can learn new technologies and methodologies, and make a significant contribution to the success of the team and the company.
